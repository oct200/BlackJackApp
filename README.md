# BlackJack-App
BlackJack application, created in Visual Studio, as a Windows Forms Application, using C#, .NET and SQL, made as a high school project.
(I know the code is very messy and unorganized, as I was at the beginning of my coding journey, but it was one of my favorite projects to work on =)
Also, I could not upload the database file to GitHub, as it was bigger than 100mb, containing photos of multiple decks of cards the player could play with)

Main functionalities:
  - playing matches of blackjack with all actions: double down, split, etc.
  - access to statistics of the account, as matches won, dollars won or longest winning streak
  - the option to switch between 5 decks of cards based on the account's statistics

Technologies used:
  - C# + .net (Project made as Windows Forms Application)
  - SQL (MSSQL Local Database File)
